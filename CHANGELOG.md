# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Re-point the `notes` library dependency from `github.com/dreikanter/notesctl` to `github.com/dreikanter/notes` to follow the upstream rename. No behavior change ([#116]).
- Replace fsnotify-based watcher loop with notesctl's `Store.Watch`, switch the index to incremental `Apply` updates, and gate SSE delivery on a per-view scope (`scope=note&id=X` for single-note views, `scope=list` for index pages). Adds `POST /api/index/refresh` plus a topbar refresh button and visibilitychange-driven reconcile so missed events are recovered on tab focus. ([#110])

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Replace the mounted tree sidebar with metadata-driven browsing: recent notes, tag/type filters, Tags/Types/Dates index pages, compact note metadata headers, and UID-based editor launch. ([#113])
- Refactor sidebar into a reusable client-side `TreeView` component. Tree state (expanded, selected, focus) lives in the browser; the server exposes `/api/tree/list` for children and a unified `/events` SSE stream that emits both file-change and directory-mutation events. ([#88])
- Trim long autolinks in rendered notes with a trailing ellipsis at the last path-segment boundary; the full URL stays in `href` and is exposed via a `title` tooltip, and a CSS rule wraps anything not trimmed. ([#93])
- Rename the project, module path, command, executable, settings, and UI branding from notesview/notes-view to nview. ([#104])
